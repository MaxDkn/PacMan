# PACMAN Project in Python with Pygame

This project aims to recreate the famous PACMAN game by Kevin Fedyna using the Pygame module in Python. The initial version of the game was originally designed for Fedyna Kevin's Numworks calculator.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to launch the PACMAN game on your computer:

1. **Install Pygame:**
   Make sure you have Pygame installed. If not, install it using the following command:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Download the Source Code:**
   Clone or download the source code of this repository to your machine.

3. **Run the Game:**
   Navigate to the directory containing the source code and run the main file with Python:
   ```
   python pacman.py
   ```

That's it! You should now see PACMAN in action on your screen. Enjoy the game!

## Version Objectives

- **Version 1 (Current):** Reproduction of the PACMAN game using Pygame, adapted for a computer.
  
- **Version 2 (Goal):** Code improvement to specifically adapt the PACMAN game for computers by optimizing and adding features.

- **Version 3 (Future):** Integration of a new multiplayer mode with options for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 players.
